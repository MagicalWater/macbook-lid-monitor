# Production LaunchDaemon Implementation Task Reviews

## Task 1 — Typed configuration and modes

### Implementation

- Added a typed `disabled / dry-run / enabled` production mode model.
- Added strict schema-v1 plist decoding with an allowlist of supported keys.
- Reused `LidSleepPolicy` validation as the single policy authority.
- Added a fixed-path loader for `/Library/Application Support/MacBookLidMonitor/config.plist`.
- Added injectable file metadata/read seams so ownership and permissions are testable without
  touching `/Library`.

### TDD evidence

- RED: focused tests failed because the production configuration types did not exist.
- GREEN: seven focused tests pass after minimal implementation.

### Immediate review findings

#### P1 — Group ownership was not validated

Root ownership alone would permit a non-wheel group. The production packaging contract requires
`root:wheel`.

**Resolution:** Added a failing regression test and required group ID `0`.

#### P1 — Blank hardware profile IDs were accepted

A whitespace-only identifier could pass decoding but could never authorize a hardware profile.

**Resolution:** Added a failing regression test and stable `invalid-hardware-profile-id` error.

### Re-review

- Unknown keys and unsupported schema/modes fail closed: pass.
- Invalid policy cannot produce enabled configuration: pass.
- Configuration path is fixed and not caller-overridable: pass.
- Symlink, non-root owner/group, and group/world-writable file fail closed: pass.
- No production runtime or system path is mutated: pass.

### Verification

- Focused: 7 tests, 0 failures.
- Full: 118 tests, 0 failures.
- Release build: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Residual system state: unchanged; no `/Library` write or launchd operation.

### Disposition

**Task 1 approved and complete.**
